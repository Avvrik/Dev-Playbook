## To start coding, you need to know two main things:  

**1. Which tools to use to run your code**  

**2. A programming language**  

Moving from basic “Hello, world!” coding to blockchain development simply means learning more tools and languages.  
A bit of theory on programming and blockchain fundamentals will go a long way.  

---

## 1. Learn the tools  
- **Git & GitHub** → Git is a version control system that lets you track changes in your code and collaborate with others. GitHub is a cloud platform for hosting Git repositories, sharing projects, and contributing to open source. 

## 2. Pick up your first languages  
- **Python** → Beginner-friendly, readable, and widely used in data analysis, scripting, and automation. It’s also used in some blockchain contexts (e.g., writing Solana programs in Anchor via PySolana, or building backend tools), though not as much for smart contracts themselves.  
- **JavaScript** → The core language for making websites and blockchain apps interactive. It’s essential for building dApp frontends and for using libraries like `ethers.js` or `web3.js` to connect to blockchains. Learning JavaScript also makes it easier to pick up **TypeScript**, which many apps use for frontend development.  

## 3. Understand the principles of programming and blockchain  
- **Programming fundamentals** → Concepts like variables, functions, algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming.  
- **Blockchain fundamentals** → How blockchains work, what transactions are, and why decentralization matters.
