Moving from “Hello, world!” to blockchain isn’t magic ✨ — it’s just learning a few new tools, languages, and mental models.  
The real difference is that on Ethereum, your code doesn’t just run on your machine — it runs on a decentralized network and costs real money to execute.

## 1. Keep Your Existing Skills — They Still Matter

**Python** 🐍 → Great for scripting, automation, data analysis, and backend logic. You’ll use it to interact with blockchain APIs, run off-chain scripts, or query on-chain data. Libraries like **web3.py** (Ethereum) or **solana-py** (Solana) make this easy.

**JavaScript** 📜 → Your main frontend and scripting tool. Blockchain frontends are just web apps that talk to the blockchain. You’ll use JS/TS + blockchain SDKs (e.g., **ethers.js** for Ethereum, **@solana/web3.js** for Solana) to connect your UI to deployed programs or contracts.

## 2. Learn the Blockchain-Specific Tools

**Node.js & npm** ⚙️ → You already need these for JavaScript — you’ll now also use them to install blockchain libraries and developer tools.

**Local Development Environments** 🧪  
- **Ethereum ecosystem** 🟦 → Hardhat or Foundry (compile, deploy, test smart contracts locally and on testnets).  
- **Solana ecosystem** 🟨 → Solana CLI + Anchor framework (build, test, and deploy Solana programs).

**Wallets** 👛  
- **Metamask** 🦊 for EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, etc.)  
- **Phantom / Solflare** 🪄 for Solana

**Block Explorers** 🔍  
- **Etherscan** for Ethereum and other EVM chains  
- **Solscan** for Solana

## 3. Learn Your First Smart Contract / Program Language

**Solidity** 🪙 → The main smart contract language for Ethereum and EVM chains. Syntax is similar to JavaScript, so it’s beginner-friendly if you know JS.

**Rust** 🦀 → The main language for Solana programs. It’s stricter and more low-level than JS/Python, but learning the basics early will make transitioning easier later.

💡 **Tip:** You don’t have to learn both at once. Start with one ecosystem (Ethereum or Solana), but keep in mind how the concepts map across chains.

## 4. Understand What’s Different from Regular Apps 

**Public by Default** 📂 → Variables, functions, and state are visible to anyone.

**Transaction Costs** ⛽ → Your code runs on a decentralized network; users pay fees (gas on Ethereum, lamports on Solana) for computation and storage.

**Testnets Are Your Sandbox** 🏖️ → Use Sepolia/Holesky (Ethereum) or Devnet (Solana) to experiment without spending real tokens.
