Solana development means working in **two layers**:  
- **On-chain** ‚Üí Programs (smart contracts) run on the validator network  
- **Off-chain** ‚Üí Apps/scripts interact with programs via RPC

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Keep Your Existing Skills

- **Python** ‚Üí Great for automation, bots, and querying data with [`solana-py`](https://github.com/michaelhly/solana-py).  
- **JavaScript / TypeScript** ‚Üí Essential for frontends and tooling with [`@solana/web3.js`](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/).

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Learn the Solana Stack

- **Solana CLI** ‚Üí Keys, airdrops, deployment, account inspection  
- **Anchor Framework** ‚Üí Beginner-friendly, reduces Rust boilerplate  
- **Test Environments** ‚Üí Localnet (offline), Devnet (public testnet)  
- **Wallets** ‚Üí Phantom, Solflare for signing transactions  
- **Explorer** ‚Üí View transactions, accounts, programs

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Learn Rust for On-Chain Work

Focus on:  
- Accounts and how they store state  
- Instruction handlers (transaction logic)  
- PDAs (Program Derived Addresses)  
- CPI (calling other programs)  

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Solana Concepts

- Account-based state ‚Äî data lives outside the program  
- Transactions can have multiple instructions  
- Low fees, but watch compute limits  
- Recent blockhashes for transaction validity  

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ First Project Path

1. Install Solana CLI + Anchor  
2. Write & deploy a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù program locally  
3. Interact via JS/Python script  
4. Build a simple program (counter, token, NFT minter)  
5. Deploy to Devnet and test with a wallet

üí° **Pro Tip**  
Master the **accounts model** early ‚Äî it‚Äôs the core mental model for Solana. Deploy small programs often and learn by iterating.
